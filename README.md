# Password Generator

I'm aware this project could have been titled *YAPG* (Yet Another Password Generator). I built it because I need a password generator that:

1. is fast.
1. lives in the browser but works locally.
1. can run offline.
1. requires as few clicks as possible to get a password.
1. promotes the use of long-ish passwords.

## Implementation details

The project is based on [Bradley-H](https://github.com/Bradley-H/passwordGenerator)'s work and is powered by SvelteKit.
